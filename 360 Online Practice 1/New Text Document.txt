Image a scenario:
The CS department head want you to create a student management system. The high level person only provide you with a literature document:
We want to store the student data into the system and. We can modify and show the data. For student data, it should include the fields: name, time start, year, department, affiliation, email, phone, tuition. The jobs of the students are taking courses, exam, and project, attend clubs.
You donâ€™t need to do too much. The only thing you need to do in this class is to use the newly learned abstract class and interface to implement a structure for the student information.

You will create three java classes: the Student abstract class, the Student interface, and Student concrete class.
Student abstract class should includes: the mutable fields (variables) and abstract methods and concrete methods ( you can implement what all the students will do in here).
The Student interface should includes: the constant fields (variables) and abstract methods. The Student concrete class just extends the Student abstract class and implements Student interface (nothing else to do).
Please copy and paste the finish code into this question.
The hint is the example of faculty management system in the video in this assignment!

name..... abstract class

time start.... interface

year..... interface

department..... Abstract class

affiliation.... interface 

email..... interface

phone .....  Interface  ( it doesn't get changed so I didn't use Abstract class )... remains fixed

tuition.... Abstract class
